Tableau project analyzing sales and discounts for a furniture e-commerce business

## 🎯 Goal
Design a dashboard to help a digital marketing manager analyze sales performance, product trends, and discount effectiveness for a furniture e-commerce website.

## 📊 Insights
- Sales grew from April to June, then slightly declined in summer.
- Quantity rose in August while AOV dropped — suggesting lower-priced purchases.
- Discounts (~18%) increased over time, showing they strongly drive sales.
- Desk and Bedroom categories generate 60%+ of sales, creating dependency risk.
- Diversifying the product mix and promoting weaker categories can balance growth.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Cleaned and joined orders and events tables in **PostgreSQL**.
- Handled nulls, duplicates, and missing IDs.
- Created derived metrics like discount %, AOV, and session duration.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **SQL (PostgreSQL)** — for cleaning and transformation  
- **Tableau** — for visualization and storytelling  
- **Excel / CSV** — for initial data structure
